Building a Map using Kinect sensor
==================================

In this tutorial, you will learn how to build your own map using Kinect sensor attached to your turtlebot. 

.. WARNING::
    Make sure that you already made the tutorial on :ref:`openKinect-turtlebot`.

As mentioned in :ref:`openKinect-turtlebot`, ROS indigo supports by default ``Asus Live Pro`` 3D sensor and has no default support to ``Kinect`` 3D sensor. 
If you use ``Asus Live Pro`` 3D sensor, then skip the Kinect 3D sensor configuration step below. 

Kinect 3D sensor configuration
==============================

In order to connect the ``Kinect`` sensor with the ROS Indigo environment, you can type the following three commands in your ``.bashrc`` file:

.. code-block:: bash

	export TURTLEBOT_3D_SENSOR=kinect
	export TURTLEBOT_BASE=kobuki
	export TURTLEBOT_STACKS=hexagons

Then save, exit and close the terminal.
Open a new terminal. 

Start Mapping ROS Nodes
=======================

On the master node (the robot machine) run the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash
	
	roscore
	roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch
	roslaunch turtlebot_navigation gmapping_demo.launch

On your workstation (the host node), run the following commands:

.. WARNING::
    If you execute the following command on your workstation (recommended), you must make sure to have correctly set-up the network configuration as explained in :ref:`network-config-doc`.


.. code-block:: bash

	roslaunch turtlebot_rviz_launchers view_navigation.launch
	roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch

.. TIP::
	OR connect to the Master node using the ``ssh turtlebot_PC_name@TURTLEBOT_IP`` command before running any command in every terminal you use and run all the previous commands, except for the ``RViz`` command run it in a normal terminal(without using ``ssh``).

Start moving the robot around using ``keyboard teleop`` application or a joytsick and watch the RViz simulator as the map starts to be built-up. 

Finally you will end-up with a map looking like this one:

.. image:: images/kenict_map.png
    :align: center

You can save the map you just created by running the following command:

.. code-block:: bash
	
	rosrun map_server map_saver -f /tmp/my_map

.. NOTE::
	The ``tmp`` file gets cleaned everytime the system is booted so after saving the map you can move the files to another location or save it in another location directly.
