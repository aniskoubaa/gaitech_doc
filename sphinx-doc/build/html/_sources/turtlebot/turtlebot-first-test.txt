Starting The Turtlebot
======================
First, connect the Kobuki base and 3D sensor camera (Kinect or Asus) to the laptop and start ROS. 
The first thing you need to do, is to turn-on turtlebot functionalities and this is performed through the bringup operation that starts all the sensors and actuators of the Turtlebot, namely, the Kobuki based and the 3D sensor.
Open a terminal and write:
``roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch``
