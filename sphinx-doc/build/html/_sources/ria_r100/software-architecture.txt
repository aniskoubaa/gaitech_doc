Software Architecture
=====================

RIA-R100 PC has been set with Ubuntu 14.04 and ROS-Indigo running on it. All the required libraries and software packages has been configured completely to work RIA. source files have been provided at catkin_ws folder in home directory. Itâ€™s easy to add required packages into this folder and compiling them. Make sure base folder remains same. Altering contents in this folder may lose required parameters controlling RIA motors.
	

All packages required to use RIA is configured at RIA folder and rest which are required to use after integrating sensors are kept outside RIA folder. Additional packages are suggested to keep outside RIA folder which helps to backup and segregate easily when required.
